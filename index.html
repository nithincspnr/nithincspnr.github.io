                    <h3>Frontend developer w/ Node js expertise</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, I specialize in Frontend, creating modular components to build
                        scalable applications using ReactJS. Earlier in my career I used the scripting language PHP to
                        build web applications. JQuery and other JS libraries were used to manage the UI at that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always had an interest in learning JavaScript. When I joined a new organization I got an
                        opportunity to work in Node.js to build backend API system, using a few databases. And now
                        for a couple of years, I am completely focusing on the Frontend side where I use React JS, HTML,
                        CSS along with other UI tools to build beautiful Frontend apps!
